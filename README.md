# RideShare

The RideShare web application is a platform to connect various travellers or tourists travelling from a common point of origin to the same destination. Users can post their travelling plans through this application, and interested users can join their trip. 

Travelers can create an account and after signing in, they can create an event to search for carpool givers or ride seekers depending upon their need. The users can create an event and input the details of their journey such as date of journey, source and destination, and a brief description if they want. Based on their input, the application will provide a list of carpool givers or ride seekers who are looking forward to sharing their journey.

The web application also provides the feature of user management. After the user creates an account, they will have a profile page in which they can provide their general information such as name, email address, phone number, profession, bio and a profile picture. The user can update their profile any time they want. In case they forget their password, the application provides a feature using which the user can reset it using their registered email address. The application also provides a user the freedom to delete their account anytime they want.

Apart from creating events and managing a user profile, the web application also maintains a log of all the rides that a user had in history. Also, after a user has requested to share a ride or has accepted any request, they will be notified using the notification feature in the web application.
By developing RideShare, our objective is to help the users in reducing the cost of their travels and make their journey less stressful and worth remembering. We also want to contribute towards the welfare of our environment by developing an application that promotes ride sharing which can lead to a smaller number of vehicles on the road and thus less air pollution and traffic congestion.
